# GoMILP

<u>*A work in progress.*</u>

The scope of this project is to build a simple, reliable MILP solver with an easy to use API in pure Go. Several alternatives ([1](https://github.com/draffensperger/golp),[2](https://github.com/lukpank/go-glpk),[3](https://github.com/costela/golpa)) exist in the form of CGO bindings with older LP solver libraries. While excellent pieces of software, I found their dependence on external libraries a big downside for use cases where maximum portability is key.

This project features an implementation of a ('lazy') branch-and-bound method for solving Mixed Integer Linear Programs. The applied branch and bound procedure is basically a heuristic-guided  search over an enumeration tree that is generated on the fly. In this tree, each node is a particular relaxation of the original problem with additional heuristically determined constraints. To solve each LP relaxation, we use [Gonum's excellent implementation]() of the [Simplex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex_algorithm) algorithm.



# Dependencies

Go dependencies are managed using [Go dep](https://github.com/golang/dep). See `Gopkg.lock` and `Gopkg.toml`.

For testing, solutions to randomized MILPs are compared to solutions produced by the GNU Linear Programming Kit, using its [Go bindings](https://github.com/lukpank/go-glpk). To install `libglpk` on macOs, simply run `brew install glpk`.



# TODO

### Hurdles

- [ ] Prevent matrix singularity introduced by problem preprocessing 
- [ ] Problem preprocessing code is still messy and needs some unit tests.
- [ ] All rummikub problems in the unit tests of `rummiGo` have integer-feasible initial relaxationsâ€¦  Write tests with more complex problems that tax the branch-and-bound procedure


### Enhancements

- [ ] simple presolver operations (see the Huang thesis in references):
    - [x] removing empty rows (all zeroes)
    - [ ] removing empty columns
    - [x] removing (implicitly) fixed variables
      - currently modifies the original problem (through a variable pointer), this is ugly!
  - [x] remove duplicated rows
    - [ ] substitute singleton rows
    - [ ] substitute singleton columns
- [ ] inject a hook to allow instrumentation (logging) of the presolver operations
- [ ] primal/dual solving
- [ ] problem preprocessing of non-root nodes in the enumeration tree?
- [ ] variables are currently subject to nonnegativity constraints by default.
- [ ] Formal testing against [problems with known solutions](http://miplib.zib.de/miplib2010.php)? ([MPS parser](https://github.com/dennisfrancis/mps) needed)
- [ ] Cancellation currently only possible when bnb procedure has been started. We may want to be able to cancel the solving of the initial relaxation too.
- [ ] Deal with infeasible subproblems created after branching on a particular integrality-constrained variable of a LP feasible problem. Should this be a noop (currently) or should branching be retried on another integer constrained variable?
- [ ] Enumeration tree exploration queue is currently FIFO. For depth-first exploration, we should go with a LIFO queue.
- [ ] Add heuristic determining which node gets explored first (as we are using depth-first search) https://nl.mathworks.com/help/optim/ug/mixed-integer-linear-programming-algorithms.html?s_tid=gn_loc_drop#btzwtmv
- [ ] how to deal with matrix degeneracy in subproblems? Currently handled the same way as infeasible subproblems.
- [ ] In branched subproblems: is it sensible to intiate the simplex at solution of parent? (using argument of lp.Simplex)
- [ ] does fiddling with the simplex tolerance value improve outcomes?
- [ ] Currently implemented only the simplest branching heuristics. Room for improvement such as expensive branching heuristics like node (pseudo-)costs.
- [ ] Enumeration tree exploration heuristics: use priority queue-based on heuristics like total path cost or a best-first approach based on earlier solutions.


- [ ] CI procedure should include race detector and test timeouts
- [ ] sanity checks before converting Problem to a MILPproblem, such as NaN, Inf, and matrix shapes and variable bound domains.
- [ ] write benchmarks for time (and space?) usage
- [ ] small(?) performance gains may be made by switching dense matrix datastructures over to sparse ones for bigger problems. This could be facilitated by employing Gonum's mat.Matrix interface.
